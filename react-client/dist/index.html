	  <p style="font-size:4vw;"> A Brief Introduction </p>
	  <p> My name is Brett. </p>
	  <p> I'm an undergraduate CS Major at Georgia Tech with a German Minor. </p>
	  <p> My interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
	  <p> My goal is to use technology to improve people's day-to-day lives. </p>
    <p> I'm graduating in Spring 2019, and I'm looking for a fulltime position that starts shortly after. </p>
	  <p margin = 0px> This website was built with the following tools: </p>

	    <img class = "logo2" width : "+2" src = "nodejs.png">

  <div display: in-line-block; margin: 0 0 0px; padding-bottom = 100%; class = "textblock">
    <p margin-top = 2% padding-top = 40% style = "font-size:4vw;" id = "projects"> Projects</p>
    <p> Chatbot </p>
    <p> I built a web application that uses Artificial Intelligence to talk with the user.  The bot talks in German because my goal is to design a technology that helps people learn.  I used Angular, Fhirbase, and Dialog Flow to make this.  </p>
    <p> WishList App </p>
    <p> I built an iOS app that lets users see what other people want as presents.  The user can log in, modify their wish list, and anonymously mark gifts on other wish lists as bought.</p>    
    <p> Icon Based Asthma Action Plan</p>
    <p> I was on a team of four students researching the effectiveness of Icon-Based Asthma Action Plan App in comparison to Text-Based Action Plan.  Our goal was to design an application that makes it easier for caregivers to treat children with asthma.  The research is ongoing. </p>

    <p> Pacman </p>
    <p> I implemented breadth first search, depth first search, A* search, and a corner search in a game of Pacman.  I also designed an admissible and consistent heuristic for Pacman to find the dots in all four corners. </p>
    <p> Codepen/Lynda paths </p>
    <p2> I frequently work on CS tutorials.  My completed pathways on Lynda include Artificial Intelligence, iOS, Data Analysis, and Object Oriented Design.  I also have a portfolio of web-based projects on Codepen. </p2>

        I'm an avid traveler and language hobbyist.  My favorite countries I've been to so far are Estonia, Finland, and Chile. I speak English, German, and an intermediate level of self-taught Spanish.  I like learning the basics of other languages like Portuguese, French, and Japanese.
